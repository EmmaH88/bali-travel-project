              <h3>Never-ending adventure</h3>
              <p>
                There‚Äôs an activity for every adventurous soul in Bali. Catch
                the surf breaks at Bali‚Äôs most popular surfing spots or rent a
                board and start learning to ride the waves. Jump from the cliffs
                and slide down a natural waterslide in Aling-Aling Waterfall, or
                enjoy intricate artificial slides and other activities at the
                Waterbom. Descend into the sea inside a submarine, dive by
                yourself or experience walking on the seabed. You name it, Bali
                has it.

              <p>
                Bali‚Äôs beauty goes way deeper than its beautiful appearances.
                The island is also home to many traditional cultural traditions
                that are still practiced. The Balinese hold many ceremonies and
                celebrations throughout the year, lots of which can be enjoyed
                by curious tourists, from the Omed-Omedan kissing festival to
                the monster parade before the day of silence (Nyepi). Tourists
                can also enjoy Bali‚Äôs culture through music, dance and
                architecture.
